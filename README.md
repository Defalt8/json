# JSON library for C++

A header-only library for simple JSON parsing, printing, manipulation and serialization.

## Features

- Parsing and printing using standard streams. Any std::ostream/std::istream derivative can be used.
Stream parsing and printing is good for recieving and sending over a network optimally.
- Direct and indirect manipulation of the json object model.
- Serialization of simple and complex data types. For complex data types or new data types you must implement
the simple `Serializer` specialization under the namespace json.

## Examples

```c++
// TO-DO: write a lot of examples.
```
